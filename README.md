# Game-Development
This project is a simple fantasy game feature using the MERN stack. Users can create and manage teams by selecting players (up to 11). The backend handles data with RESTful APIs, and the React frontend allows users to view players, form teams, and display team details. It includes error handling, validation, and responsive design.
